 * IDataManager
 * The data manager is responsible for loading game metadata in memory and exposing it to other systems.
 * Assets are also managed here, though this might change.
 * Currently vertex and fragment shaders should be compiled as they are referenced and only their handles are accessible to the other systems.
 * Models, meshes, and textures will also need special consideration.
