/*
 ***************************
 * Player Input Component
 * This component is the "AI controller" for the player's unit.
 * It is responsible for sending movement to the movement component and ability orders to the ability component.
 * It is likely that early in development this component's update routine will fix the game camera to it's entity's actor location.
 * At this stage of development there should never be more than one of these components at a time.
